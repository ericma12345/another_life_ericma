The way she is able to do this is extremely fascinating, but in many ways, the importance of the message her song sends to the audience is what’s crucial in today’s chaotic society. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To have a strong sense of self-esteem is a trait that will not only be beneficial for your own wellbeing, but also impact the way others perceive you. In addition to this, your physical and mental health can be significantly impacted by how much you accept yourself and the level of confidence you hold. Several studies have shown the positive effect self esteem has on one, but one paper in particular, “Is High Self-Esteem Beneficial? Revisiting a Classic Question” written by Ulrich Orth and Richard W Robins outlines this concept through several different tests and perspectives. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The abstract of the paper explains how self-esteem is a multifaceted concept that is influential to one’s life regardless of your race, age, or gender. It also walks through how having higher self-esteem impacts the different “domains” of life including: “relationships, school, work, mental health, physical health, and antisocial behavior” (Orth and Robins 2023, 5). The overall findings of the study are that higher self-esteem will benefit people individually in all these domains and can lead to a better society as a whole. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to mental health, the article states how low self-esteem and little self acceptance is, in many cases, the origin of depression (Orth and Robins 2023,10). By using meta-analysis which is a form of statistical analysis that combines multiple sets of data and studies to create new findings and conclusions, this study determined that self-esteem “prospectively predicted” examples of depression and anxiety in several different cases (10). Put more simply, this research showed that people with higher levels of self-esteem were less likely to experience these mental health struggles. Additionally, the author explains that differing levels of self-esteem holds for both “affective-cognitive (e.g., depressed mood, hopelessness) and somatic (e.g., poor appetite, disturbed sleep) symptoms of depression” and doesn’t restrict itself to just one category of depression (10). After discussing several other studies that surveyed groups of people with differences in gender and education level, the section regarding mental health concluded that individuals with low self-esteem are much more likely to experience mental health issues.  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the study dives into how self confidence will also be able to impact one’s physical health. This section initially states how an individual with higher self-esteem will be more willing to ask for support when they need it which can lead to healthier cardiovascular, endocrine, and immune systems (Orth and Robins 2023,10). It then goes on to explain the various longitudinal studies that were performed to show how different levels of self-esteem will impact physical health. Longitudinal studies are essentially a type of research study that collects data from the same individual or group of people for a long period of time to find different trends that occur over time. In a study that spanned over 12 years, high self-esteemed individuals showed decreases in 10 different health issues that included things like high blood pressure, stroke, and diabetes (10). Another study used a sample size of 700 older adults who differed in self-esteem and found that the ones with higher levels had better functional health, primarily meaning the ability to do everyday tasks, and were more motivated to perform different exercises that would improve the current states of their health (10). Similar to the section discussing mental health, this section came to the conclusion that people with higher self-esteem are generally healthier based on both very objective and subjective measurements of health.  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with hundreds and thousands of studies and papers on the human brain, it is still a topic that we as a species have only begun to scratch the surface of. Even the paper admits that the number of studies and amount of data they used was small in the grand scheme of things, but the main takeaways were all consistent with each other. It might not be extremely difficult to find flaws in research regarding this topic, but from this paper it can be concluded that having a high level of self-esteem and recognizing your own self-worth is something that will benefit your life. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, today’s society is extremely critical of any actions you make as an individual. More often than not, your flaws will be pointed out rather than your strengths. It has become more difficult to be confident in yourself because of this environment where information travels so quickly, but it is important to embrace who you are and be proud of it. SZA uses her music to send this message she too wants to acknowledge this challenge many of us face even if it might seem unrealistic. It is inevitable that unexpected things will occur in life, but like SZA expresses and this study explains, it is worth it to keep your head up and stay confident. </span></p><p><br><br><br><br><br></p><p><strong><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/introduction.html" style="color: #3598db;">introduction</a></strong></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/critical-reading-assignment.html">Critical Reading Assignment - The R&amp;B Life</a></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/music-review.html">Music Review - Diving into Another Life</a></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/playlist-and-listening-guide.html">Playlist &amp; Listening Guide - Traveling Through Life</a></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/bibliography.html">Bibliography</a></p><p><br><br></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
