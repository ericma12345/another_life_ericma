Near the middle of the song, SZA mentions self-respect and sings in a very bold and confident manner, communicating the importance of self-esteem. The way she is able to do this is fascinating, but more importantly, the message her song sends to the audience is what’s crucial in today’s chaotic society. This is a topic that has altered the psychological mindset of many individuals and is important to discuss. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The implications of SZA’s message regarding acceptance and self-esteem are what’s fascinating to examine. A strong sense of self-esteem is a trait that will not only be beneficial for your own wellbeing, but also impact the way others perceive you. Several studies have shown the positive effects of self-esteem, but one paper in particular, “Is High Self-Esteem Beneficial? Revisiting a Classic Question” written by Ulrich Orth and Richard W Robins, outlines this concept through several different tests and perspectives. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The introduction of the paper explains how self-esteem is a multifaceted concept that is influential to one’s life regardless of your race, age, or gender. It also walks through how having higher self-esteem impacts the different “domains” of life including: “relationships, school, work, mental health, physical health, and antisocial behavior” (Orth and Robins 2023, 5). The overall findings of the study are that higher self-esteem will benefit people individually in all these domains and can lead to a better society as a whole. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to mental health, the article states how low self-esteem and little self-acceptance is, in many cases, the origin of depression (Orth and Robins 2023,10).  Meta-analysis is a form of statistical analysis that combines multiple sets of data and studies to create new findings and conclusions. This study used meta-analysis to determine that self-esteem “prospectively predicted” examples of depression and anxiety in several different cases (10). Put more simply, this research showed that people with higher levels of self-esteem were less likely to experience these mental health struggles. Additionally, the author explains that differing levels of self-esteem holds for both “affective-cognitive (e.g., depressed mood, hopelessness) and somatic (e.g., poor appetite, disturbed sleep) symptoms of depression” and doesn’t restrict itself to just one category of depression (10). After discussing several other studies that surveyed groups of people with differences in gender and education level, the section regarding mental health concluded that individuals with low self-esteem are much more likely to experience mental health issues.  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the study dives into how self confidence will also be able to impact one’s physical health. This section initially states how an individual with higher self-esteem will be more willing to ask for medical and emotional support when they need it which can lead to healthier cardiovascular, endocrine, and immune systems (Orth and Robins 2023,10). It then goes on to explain the various longitudinal studies that were performed to show how different levels of self-esteem will impact physical health. Longitudinal studies are essentially a type of research study that collects data from the same individual or group of people for a long period of time to find different trends that occur over time. In a study that spanned over 12 years, high self-esteemed individuals showed decreases in ten different health issues that included things like high blood pressure, stroke, and diabetes (10). Another study used a sample size of 700 older adults who differed in self-esteem and found that the ones with higher levels had better functional health, primarily meaning the ability to do everyday tasks, and were more motivated to perform different exercises that would improve the current states of their health (10). Similar to the section discussing mental health, this section came to the conclusion that people with higher self-esteem are generally healthier based on both very objective and subjective measurements of health.  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Female artists in R&amp;B, including SZA, are a perfect, real-life example of how confidence and self-esteem is crucial towards happiness as well as creating an impact. In a study titled, “There’s Some Whores in this House: An Examination of Female Sexuality in R&amp;B/Hip Hop and Pop Music, 1991–2021,” the authors look at how the sexually explicit lyrics female artists gain more traction than male artists, and how female artists fought those social norms. This study revealed that female artists weren’t afraid to deliver their own thoughts and messages through their music even if it was “inappropriate” or meant to be hidden (Griffin et al. 2023, 610). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, SZA points out that, throughout her career, she found happiness with the music she was making when she stayed true to what she thought sounded good and not the different types of criticism she received. In a talk show interview with Sherri Shepherd, SZA explains how she lives life more freely with confidence, which is how she has been able to succeed (Shepard 2025). In Robert Patterson’s book, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Destructive Desires: Rhythm and Blues Culture and the Politics of Racial Equality</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he addresses an adjacent idea regarding the fallacies of how marriage is what will guarantee happiness for someone. Instead, Patterson points out that systemic inequalities and racial disparities will continue regardless of the status of your relationship with someone (Patterson 2019, 27). He emphasizes how expressing yourself, like artists have done in R&amp;B, is what can fuel you. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Another Life” is a song about a breakup. SZA shows us her lack of self-esteem when he worries about her own image in the beginning of the song. Yearning for perfection and approval is something what she believes to be possible, but comes to a realization as the song progresses. With this change in mindset, the feeling of the music changes as well, becoming more upbeat. The conclusion of the song shows the listener the freedom and energy you get from being confident in yourself. This is the way SZA delivers the importance of this idea. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, today’s society is extremely critical of any actions you make as an individual. More often than not, your flaws will be pointed out rather than your strengths. It has become more difficult to be confident in yourself because of this environment where information travels so quickly, but it is important to embrace who you are and be proud of it. SZA uses her music to send this message, and she too wants to acknowledge this challenge many of us face even if it might seem unrealistic. It is inevitable that unexpected things will occur in life, but like SZA expresses and this study explains, it is worth it to keep your head up and stay confident. </span></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/introduction.html">THIS LIFE</a></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/critical-reading-assignment.html">THE R&amp;B LIFE</a></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/playlist-and-listening-guide.html">TRAVELING THROUGH LIFE</a></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/music-review.html">DIVING INTO ANOTHER LIFE</a></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/bibliography.html">BIBLIOGRAPHY</a></p><p><br><br><br></p><p> </p><p><br><br></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Eric Ma</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'overlay',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
