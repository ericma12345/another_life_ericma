On the surface, the song “Another Life” seems to be a personal story about a relationship that SZA delineates to her audience, but at the same time, she explores more sophisticated themes of belonging, realizing self-worth, and feeling self-conscious in the greater scheme of life. SZA's raw and soothing vocals, paired with soft, ethereal, and rhythmic instruments, communicate a powerful message. The original studio recording of “Another Life” is the fourteenth track of the LANA extension of SZA’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">SOS</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> album and was released by Top Dawg Entertainment and RCA Records on the 20th of December in 2024. It is also the only released version of the song due to how new the album is with SZA not having gone on tour yet for this music. “Another Life,” along with most of SZA’s other music, embrace the history behind R&amp;B music and what the genre represents.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The musical elements in the sole recording of the song immediately catch the ear of a listener, evoking curiosity, in a cohesive and familiar manner. The tune begins with the repetition of four progressive, parallel chords that begin the song slow and mellow, but it is suddenly greeted by SZA’s powerful voice. Any boredom that may have been built up by the electronic chords dissipates with her vocal entrance, adding color and warmth. These chords are the rhythmic backbone of the song, standing in the shadows to let the spotlight shine brightly on SZA’s vocals. The first forty seconds of the song act as an opening statement of sorts with the repetitive chords and authoritative vocals, then a drum beat kicks in as the song progresses into the chorus. Seconds later, the song then shifts fluidly between the chorus and significant statements. SZA’s soaring voice that maintains a very grateful and optimistic tone to hook her listeners is the most fundamental and characteristic musical element of the song (D’Souza 2024). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tone and the style of this song dictate the way SZA is able to express her emotions. The song’s elements are deeply rooted in the R&amp;B genre and its extensive history. R&amp;B is directly derived from black music that was initially a form of coping and expression in the time when enslaved people were still present in America. This style of music expressed by the enslaved people originated from the culture of their native lands in Africa. This was the population of people in America who were extremely suppressed, but motivated to fight for freedom and grasped onto their music when they were essentially stripped of all their basic human rights (Redd 1974). R&amp;B is a genre that promotes self expression and identity by combining strong beats with improvised rhythms and call and response patterns (Redd 1974). Even though lots has changed since the late 1970’s when Redd’s book was written, there are still hints of these characteristic elements of the genre in “Another Life” that make the message come across strongly. The consistent beat that blends with a loosely repetitive call and response or conversational nature of the song is how it musically ties to the birth of R&amp;B. The modern side of the song is a result of producers and Disk Jockeys who have developed the technical skills that involve sampling, stretching and beat matching, giving the music a completely new feel (Mărcuță 2025). One side of the story SZA tells in this song is the idea of realizing your own self-worth and standing up for yourself. In the beginning, SZA’s lyrics reflect a very uptight nature where she strives for perfection and is afraid to disappoint her partner. Later on, she sings the powerful line “I don't wanna be just a shell of me, Just another thing in your gallery” which shows the progression of SZA’s mindset from the beginning of the song where there is a lot of uncertainty and nervousness (SZA 2024). Although she is directly discussing how she is getting over someone, this concept can be applied to the realization of self respect you should have for yourself. Looking at it from a slightly different perspective, the enslaved people who indirectly pioneered this genre had a similar belief as well–knowing they held unmeasurable value compared to the horrific ways they were being treated.  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, SZA reveals the hesitation and nervousness she felt in her own life as she tried making a living through her musical creations (Exposito 2023). Her interviewer, Suzy Exposito, asks SZA what the secret was to getting to where she is today with countless tracks leading the Billboard charts. SZA admits that it was a long difficult path of self discovery and perseverance. There was a time where she had written over one hundred songs, but was extremely hesitant about releasing anything to the public because she didn’t feel ready. By building confidence, experimenting, and acknowledging the unpredictable creative process that was required to make music she was comfortable with sharing with the world (Exposito 2023).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Another Life” also delivers the larger message that it is everyone’s first time at life and it is important to not be so hard on yourself. While you need to have a lot of confidence in yourself and what you do, it is virtually impossible to do everything correctly without fail. The line “can’t risk perfection” is extremely thought provoking and corroborates this message of acceptance (SZA 2024). Not risking perfection can mean a variety of things, but SZA wants to say that risking perfection is an unattainable idea since life is filled with so much risk while perfection is void of it. This is a claim that is applicable and incredibly relatable in this day and age, being the a reason why “Another Life” is such a powerful piece of music. Due to how fast paced information travels in society, some may feel an expectation or yearning for perfection. SZA says, yes, you should know your self-worth and be brave, but you’re bound to hit roadblocks, and only in “another life” does everything work out the way you intend. Even until the last line of the song, uncertainty is present when SZA admits that “maybe” everything works out “in another life” (SZA 2024).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hesitation is inevitable. Everyone will encounter moments where they question what they are doing, but SZA’s “Another Life” allows us to understand that in this fast paced world, only an alternate reality is where the time is always right and everything occurs flawlessly. SZA makes a lasting impression in her music by utilizing different aspects of the R&amp;B genre from the emotional strength of the genre’s rich history to the unique, soulful musical elements. </span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4tfOoCcYPtb08J5HWlSo3r?si=898190c55c914ae8">Spotify Recording</a></p><p> </p><p><span style="color: #236fa1;"><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/introduction.html">THIS LIFE</a></span></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/critical-reading-assignment.html">THE R&amp;B LIFE</a></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/playlist-and-listening-guide.html">TRAVELING THROUGH LIFE</a></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/final-essay.html">BE CONFIDENT IN YOUR LIFE</a></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/bibliography.html">BIBLIOGRAPHY</a></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/lyrics.html">LYRICS</a></p><p> </p><p><br><br></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Eric Ma</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'overlay',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
