SZA communicates powerful messages through her raw and soothing vocals that are purposely paired with soft, ethereal, and rhythmic instrumentals. The original studio recording of “Another Life” is the fourteenth track of the LANA extension of SZA’s SOS album and was released by Top Dawg Entertainment and RCA Records on the 20th of December in 2024. It is also the only performance of the song that has been released to the public in any form due to how new the album is with SZA not having gone on tour yet for her latest music. Additionally, the history behind R&amp;B music and what the genre represents is often demonstrated through SZA’s music and “Another Life” is no exception to that. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting the lyrics aside, the musical elements of the recording are a component that catches the ear of a listener, evoking curiosity, in a cohesive and familiar manner. The tune begins with the repetition of four different progressive, parallel chords that begin the song slow and mellow, but it is suddenly greeted by SZA’s powerful voice. Any boredom that may have been built up by the electronic chords dissipates with her entrance which adds color and warmth to the song.  These chords are the rhythmic backbone of the song that stand in the shadows allowing the spotlight to shine brightly on SZA’s vocals. The first forty seconds of the song act as an opening statement of sorts with the repetitive chords and authoritative vocals, then a drum beat kicks in as the song progresses into the chorus. The song then shifts fluidly between the chorus and significant statements. The most fundamental and characteristic musical element of the song is how SZA is able to hook her listeners through the way her voice soars while maintaining a very graceful and optimistic tone (D’Souza 2024). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When listening to “Another Life,” the tone and the style of the music dictate the way SZA is able to express her emotions. The song’s elements are deeply rooted in the R&amp;B genre and its extensive history. R&amp;B was initially a form of coping and expression in the time when slaves were still utilized in America. This style of music expressed by the slaves originated from the culture of their native lands in Africa. This was the population of people in America who were extremely suppressed, but motivated to fight for freedom and grasped onto their music when they were essentially stripped of all their basic human rights (Redd 1974). R&amp;B is a genre that promotes self expression and identity by combining strong beats with improvised rhythms and call and response patterns (Redd 1974). Even though lots has changed since then, there are still hints of these characteristic elements of the genre in “Another Life” that make the message come across strongly. The consistent beat that blends with somewhat of a repetitive call and response or conversational nature of the song is how it musically ties to the birth of R&amp;B. One side of the story SZA tells in this song is the idea of realizing your own self worth and standing up for yourself. The powerful line “I don't wanna be just a shell of me, Just another thing in your gallery” shows the progression of SZA’s mindset from the beginning of the song where there is a lot of uncertainty and nervousness (SZA 2024). Although she is directly discussing how she is getting over someone, this concept can be applied to the realization of self respect you should have for yourself. Looking at it from a slightly different perspective, the slaves who pioneered this genre had a similar belief as well–knowing they held unmeasurable value compared to the horrific ways they were being treated.  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To extend the concept of self-worth and belonging, a larger message “Another Life” can portray is the fact that it is everyone’s first time at life and it is important to not be so hard on yourself. While you need to have a lot of confidence in yourself and what you do, it is virtually impossible to do everything correctly without fail. The line “can’t risk perfection” is extremely thought provoking and corroborates this message of acceptance (SZA 2024). Not risking perfection can mean a variety of things, but SZA wants to say that risking perfection is an unattainable idea since life is filled with so much risk while perfection is void of it. This is a claim that is applicable and incredibly relatable in this day and age, being the main reason why “Another Life” is such a powerful piece of music. Due to how fast paced information travels in society, there seems to always be an expectation or yearning for perfection. SZA says, yes, you should know your self worth and be brave, but are bound to hit roadblocks, and only in “another life” is where everything works out to how you intend. Even till the last line of the song, uncertainty is present when SZA admits that “maybe” everything works out “in another life” (SZA 2024).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hesitation is an aspect of life that is inevitable. Everyone will encounter moments where they question what they are doing, but SZA’s “Another Life” allows us to understand that only in an alternate reality is one where the time is always right and everything occurs flawlessly. The approach SZA takes to make a lasting impression through her music is by utilizing different aspects of the R&amp;B genre from the emotional strength of the genre’s rich history to the unique, soulful musical elements. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p><p><br><br></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Works Cited</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D’Souza, Shaad. 2025. “SOS Deluxe: Lana”. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pitchfork</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> January 6. https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sza-sos-deluxe-lana/.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redd, Lawrence N. 1974. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rock is Rhythm and Blues: The Impact of Mass Media</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
