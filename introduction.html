These choices are what gives your life direction. Sometimes you have total command over these decisions. Other times, they are completely out of your control. Sometimes the outcome of these decisions is expected and other times completely random. The most difficult ideas to accept are inevitable, yet unexpected events. While remembering to accept this fact, you also must stay confident in your choices and be brave when making these decisions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In SZA’s “Another Life,” she beautifully illustrates this thought through her purposeful lyrics and expression. One of the main reasons why she is able to do so successfully is because of how the rhythm &amp; blues genre has fostered a culture that allows artists to speak their minds in a touching and relatable way for the listener. Without the platform and culture that R&amp;B brings to SZA’s music, her message would be told in a completely different way, missing the elements of what makes R&amp;B so meaningful. The way SZA is able to incorporate several classic elements of traditional R&amp;B and combine it with more recent, alternative styles is incredibly fascinating in a way that allows her to hook her listeners.  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my Critical Reading Assignment titled "The R&amp;B Life", I examine Arnold Shaw’s “Researching Rhythm &amp; Blues” from the first volume of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Music Research Journal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and his analysis on how the genre of Rhythm &amp; Blues impacted the community as a whole. Shaw points out that R&amp;B is incredibly unique and stands out because of its fusion of several different musical elements. Since R&amp;B has such a unique set of musical elements, it was able to create a lasting impact by influencing artists like Elvis Presley, teaching him the art of the genre, and allowing marginalized black communities to solidify their own culture and express their opinions through music. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving along, my Music Review titled "Diving into Another Life" dives into how SZA is able to express her thoughts through her music and carefully analyzes the lyrics of her song “Another Life.” On the surface, the song describes a broken up relationship, but then touches upon large topics of life like knowing your self worth and accepting the fact that life is incredibly unpredictable. The Music Review first references a Pitchfork article written by Shaad D’Souza about SZA’s instrumentals and soaring voice are able to hook her listeners. In a more direct manner compared to the Pitchfork article, the R&amp;B genre is mentioned again for this song by discussing what Lawernce Redd had to say about it in his book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rock is Rhythm and Blues: The Impact of Mass Media</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Redd believes that roots and traditional characteristics of R&amp;B are what allow the music to be so influential towards its listeners. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then a deep analysis of the lyrics reveals a deeper meaning behind many emotional lines touching upon the ideas of self love. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on, my Playlist &amp; Listening Guide titled "Traveling Through Life" tells a story that revolves around the message SZA is trying to deliver through her song. The playlist is composed of nine different songs and concludes with “Another Life” because that is the summary of the story that is encapsulated by the rest of the songs. Essentially, this guide walks through the stages of falling in love and eventually losing it. It paints a colorful narrative through all sorts of genres of music with varying styles that have unique rhythms and tempos, emulating this idea of uncertainty in life. It begins with very upbeat and optimistic music that only spreads the ideas of love and happiness. The middle section of the playlist then enters a darker area where there’s a lot of self reflection, self doubt, depression, and regret. Finally, the playlist shifts to a series of songs that associate self-love, taking risks, and knowing self worth. This sequence is designed to allow the listener to experience a rollercoaster of emotions and better understand this idea that SZA inspires as to think about. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Final Major Essay titled "Believe in your Life" asks why is it so important to accept what happens in your life and why should you stay confident and brave after the fact? The message SZA is expressing to her listeners is extremely important because it can be applicable to everyone. Individually, you must realize what she is trying to say and apply it to your own life in order for the message to resonate with you. Acceptance is an idea that requires the full picture to be seen. Realization is one of the first steps to embracing acceptance. Understanding why this argument is so important might help you realize what has been making you unhappy or what has been holding you back from succeeding at something.  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, “Another Life” by SZA is a song rooted in deep personal reflection. SZA has discovered an applicable idea to everyone’s lives and is able to express her ideas and emotions through her raw, soulful voice and driven lyrics. This song speaks to how R&amp;B as a genre has continued to deliver the powerful thoughts of artists through this unique style of music since times of slavery. This project demonstrates the importance of the idea that everyone encounters uncertainty in their lives.</span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/critical-reading-assignment.html">Critical Reading Assignment - The R&amp;B Life</a></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/music-review.html">Music Review - Diving into Another Life</a></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/playlist-and-listening-guide.html">Playlist &amp; Listening Guide - Traveling Through Life</a></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/final-essay.html">Final Essay - Believe in Your Life</a></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/lyrics.html">Lyrics</a> </p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/bibliography.html">Bibliography</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
