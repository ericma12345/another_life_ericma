The author takes the stance that R&amp;B, like many other black music styles, has been overlooked and ignored intentionally since the inception of the genre. In order to prove his point, Shaw is able to walk us through his thoughts by referencing an organized plethora of sources he drew inspiration from and point to examples of how R&amp;B has impacted the music community as a whole. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaw’s initial point stems from the idea that because  R&amp;B is its own genre, it’s able to have a certain experimental nature, allowing it to stand out. He attempts to prove that R&amp;B and the research conducted around it was done extremely poorly because there was “confusion about its identity” (Shaw 1980,73). R&amp;B is a genre of music that fuses a variety of different musical elements together such as boogie-woogie, jump blues, electric instruments, and different types of black gospel music(74). These are things that set it apart from classic, rural blues that is mellow in tone and has less energy and excitement. Additionally, the historic culture of R&amp;B and its origins as slave music in the deep south is what differentiates it from rock ‘n’ roll. Shaw makes it very clear that R&amp;B is truly its own entity with lots of history and distinctive stylistic features. He is able to back up this claim with all the different sources he references by disputing their statements with additional evidence. One example of this is how Shaw responded to the late Ralph J. Gleason who stated that rhythm and blues was exactly the same as rock ‘n’ roll (Shaw 1980,74). The author disputes Gleason’s point and clarifies that there might have been some confusion when he made that statement. The most likely reason this comment exists was because some R&amp;B music was labeled at rock ‘n’ roll to please white listeners who would refuse to listen to black records. With no other evidence, Gleason had a valid argument that the mislabeled music sounded like R&amp;B. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with discussing R&amp;B’s identity, Shaw is also able to dive into the lasting impact it was able to make on the music community and society as a whole.The best example of R&amp;B’s impact that Shaw makes sure to acknowledge was Elvis Presley and the success of his career. Shaw introduces this argument by stating how “Presley was nurtured on R&amp;B during his growing-up years and developed a working knowledge of R&amp;B repertoire” (Shaw 1980, 72). Shaw explains that the basis for all of Presley’s ideas later in his career that ultimately became timeless hits, all stemmed from R&amp;B. He then goes on to ask the question: would Presley have been as successful and revolutionary without a background in R&amp;B music? Shaw answers this question, pointing out that his background in R&amp;B and the black culture that surrounded it was what allowed him to prosper.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Shaw discusses how it was a difficult genre to research because of skewed data and how it was at a disadvantage by radio stations and record labels. Although Shaw was very supportive of R&amp;B and black music, most members in the industry at the time were not as accepting and it showed when research was being done on the genre. Historians found that, although vastly popular, the genre wasn’t played much on the radio and sales of disk records by mainstream labels were rare since most of the R&amp;B disks were only manufactured by tiny, independent labels. To add to the issue, a large portion of the R&amp;B artists of the time only performed live or served as disk jockeys, making it difficult to collect any quantitative data. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaw ensures that the reader can understand the powerful argument he brings forth because he references so many different sources to carefully analyze the topic at hand. The reader doesn’t ever need to take Shaw’s word for anything since he maps everything out so precisely through quotes and figures. An example of this is when Shaw quotes LeRoi Jones to prove that there were those who doubted R&amp;B’s distinctiveness. Jones says, “R&amp;B seems a less personal music than the older blues forms” and “is more easily faked”(Jones 1963, 172-73 cited in Shaw 1980, 73). Although it is true that the argument of R&amp;B being neglected and discredited for making a large impact was well backed by precise analysis, it would’ve made more sense to talk about the actual impact itself. Most of the article focused on periphery elements like how the genre was at a disadvantage when being studied rather than how R&amp;B shaped the community. Jones’ quote may have added clarification to the story, but was it necessary to include? It may have been more effective to pivot towards a quote regarding the strong impact the music made. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Shaw is able to reflect why R&amp;B is such an important genre to understand and what implications it has made on modern music. R&amp;B is a revolutionary genre of music that led to “vitality” in pop music that was able to “overwhelm a generation of teenagers, white as well as black”(Shaw 1980,79). Shaw is very fond of the rich tradition R&amp;B stemmed from as well as its “experimental freshness” (78). It’s crucial to understand why the history of the genre is so significant, directly tied to its longevity that continues to thrive today.  Shaw has revealed that it is more than just about the music–it is about communities coming together and expressing themselves, even if certain groups of people try to undermine its history and identity. </span></p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><p><span style="color: #236fa1;"><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/introduction.html" style="color: #236fa1;">THIS LIFE</a></span></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/music-review.html">DIVING INTO ANOTHER LIFE</a></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/playlist-and-listening-guide.html">TRAVELING THROUGH LIFE</a></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/final-essay.html">BE CONFIDENT IN YOUR LIFE</a></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/bibliography.html">BIBLIOGRAPHY</a></p><p><br><br><br><br></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Eric Ma</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'overlay',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
