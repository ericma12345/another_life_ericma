You sit alone at home on the couch bundled up in your warmest blanket. All you can hear is the pitter patter of the rain outside. You don’t have the energy to go turn the lights on so the bleak, grey sky casts a little light in the room as you reminisce about yesterday. Thoughts and emotions flood your consciousness as you try to piece together what happened. Everything seemed so certain, so perfect yesterday. What’s next? What did you do wrong? Was it because of you? You don’t know the answers to these questions and you won’t ever find out the full truth. This one event makes you spiral, uncertain of anything else. Images of the past play on repeat in your head and you keep circling back, trying to decipher where you took a wrong turn. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You feel like you’re barreling towards a place where things only get progressively worse because of your actions, but you need to wake up and reevaluate your worth. Remember the effort you put in. Remember the kindness you showed. Remember the sacrifice you made. And when you do, remind yourself that it’s not your fault. Remind yourself that, in many cases, it isn’t anyone’s fault. It’s just meant to be this way. Making peace with yourself is vital to your health and something you need to acknowledge in order to live a fruitful life to the fullest. This is where the sun comes out, and the dark, greyish-blue colored sky turns into a beautiful sky blue and you move in a new direction with your life. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This playlist encapsulates the journey through grief, denial, and curiosity after an event like a breakup or simply a time where you failed and then the aftermath of these feelings. This overarching journey of self reflection is present in the song “Another Life” by SZA which ties all these emotions together and teaches us that, even in the face of overwhelming self-doubt and uncertainty, we need to make sure to be forgiving to ourselves and continue to move forward with our heads held high with confidence. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love is a very complex concept. To each and every person, the word may mean very different things. The context in which the word is used also matters a lot. Although there are so many differences in how it is perceived, the majority of people will associate it with safety and timeless connection. In the song “Real Love,” Childish Gambino acknowledges many different aspects of what love means but drives home the message that he sincerely hopes the listener is able to experience and feel real love for themself. He discusses how everything was sad and cold until he was able to find that love for himself (Gambino 2024). This is the starting point of the story. Where you have this real love that provides warmth to your heart is where everyone will be at some point. Change is inevitable, but there is someone who is there for you, regardless of anything. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the beginning, there is still a lot of hope and reassurance. The song, “Night Changes” acknowledges that things in life will change very rapidly from one day to the next, but even with all this change, because “it will never change me and you” (One Direction 2014). Different things in life are constantly shifting around, but this song shows us the strength of ideas of love and trust. The mellow, yet upbeat melody evokes feelings of compassion for the listener, saying that everything will be alright even when there is change because you will always have your person who will be there for you. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filled with confidence and feeling worriless is when the worst thing will hit you out of nowhere. The safety net you relied on completely disappeared. You continue to fall, wondering what happened. The yearning to go back to what it used to be is portrayed perfectly in “Let Her Go” by Passenger through his soft, but meaningful diction and the calm guitar in the background. This is where your confusion and frustration begins. The glue to your life, the person who was supposed to always be there for you is suddenly gone. Passenger sings, “Love comes slow and it goes so fast,” knowing the harsh reality of the situation, but admits you will only realize this long after the relationship has run its course. For the meantime, all you can do is search diligently for answers. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“CHIHIRO” is a piece of music that underscores feeling lost in thought as you retrace your steps looking for clues and answers. The eternal and hypnotic atmosphere of the music represents the state of mind you enter when thinking everything through. The lyrics of the song are often questions like the ones you ask yourself to figure out what crimes you committed to deserve to feel this way. When attempting to think about how you can fix the situation, things blur together as you feel more lost than ever. The distance between you and the answer seems to grow farther and farther the more you contemplate. You’re in a place of unfamiliarity, a place you’ve never thought of visiting– yet here you are, lost. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first person you want to blame once entering this state of mind is yourself. You feel the need to find a reason, something to blame so you can find closure so naturally, you fault your own actions. Fear engulfs you as you take this stance that everything was your own doing. Luke Hemmings captures these emotions clearly in his song, “Slip Away.” His raw, honest voice is what drives the message of falling in love and feeling vulnerable once that relationship is over. Self guilt is the other half of the story that encourages you to admit you’re the one at fault. “I lied to you like a promise on New Year’s Day” sums up the way you dig up tiny things in the back of your mind to prove you were the one who ruined it (Hemmings 2021). The only way to cope and find an escape from this feeling is to find an answer that makes sense to yourself. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of renewal and recovery is a long and dark path. It is so easy to reminisce about the past, wishing you could go back any chance you got. The Weeknd illustrates this distinct sensation in his song, “Take Me Back to LA” where he reflects on his past personal experiences where he might have been happier. Many specific details are mentioned explaining to the audience how vividly he misses the past. There is a lot of hesitation when the artist discusses this topic. He begins by explaining how he enjoys being alone, but after thinking deeper about the past, he actually hates when he’s alone (The Weeknd 2025). There is a point where you convince yourself it was all for the better, but in the end, the solitude you face is something you want to avoid at all costs. And only when you reach the point of aloneness is when the regret seeps in and you want to go back. You want to take everything back, but it’s no longer an option. You need to follow the path of understanding and reason to rebuild. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it’s a very long journey to reach a resolution, eventually you need to accept what has happened and be cognizant that you can’t only blame yourself. The next song in the playlist, “Gravity,” touches upon the fact that everyone needs inner stability and knows how to resist all the negativity of the world. The metaphor of the song says that all the negative thoughts you possess will pull you down like a strong gravitational force if you aren’t careful. It is important to “keep [yourself] where the light is,” meaning you need to stay in a place of love and self acceptance to nurture your well-being (Mayer 2006). After lots of thought and a glimpse of acceptance, you will become more comfortable with the uncertainty of the future. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strong, pulsing electric guitar catches your attention immediately in the introduction to “No Plan” by Hozier. You have dealt with the path of darkness, but you're on the other side. You have a new mindset about life and have welcomed the fact that things happen for a reason and it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s your fault. The upbeat nature of the song clashes with the somewhat harsh meaning of the song that says there things will go wrong no matter what. This clashing is completely intentional. It outlines the idea of life and how, without a plan, nothing can technically go wrong (Hozier 2019). Hozier wants the listener to understand that love is something that will always be there, but at the same time, there are no guarantees in life. You need to live a life free of worry, but still be sure to put in the effort and work, and after that, just go with the flow. The greater the hardship, the stronger it will make you once you overcome it. This message is woven into the line, “The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun,” and corroborates the fact that hard work and challenges overcome will be rewarded in due time (Hozier 2019). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At last, you make peace with yourself. You understand that the only place where everything works out the way you want it to is in some alternate reality. The song “Another Life” by SZA captures this idea by focusing on self reflection and growth while valuing your own self worth. SZA stresses the importance of self worth and staying true to yourself after you’ve been through a rough patch. The difference between staying confident and blaming yourself are two very different concepts that you need to differentiate to be able to find peace. Everyone is experiencing life for the first time, so stay strong and understand that not everything will go the way you intend. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of going through such trauma is long and tedious. When you are sitting at home alone in the dark, there will be times when you’re truly disoriented and have absolutely no hope of moving forward. Tears flowing down your cheeks like a busted sprinkler pipe will only make you feel more sorrowful. It is paramount that you don’t give up hope and fight to see the sunlight come through the windows. It might seem like the sky will never change color, but in reality, it could shift instantly just like how you can shift your mindset. You might experience all the stages of grief, but there’s a reason why acceptance is the last step. SZA sends a passionate and powerful stance on our existence as individual human beings that reminds us always to stay strong and embrace the unique lives we each have.</span></p><p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2nc7inu8JzEJflktu58Hh3?si=8dbc42ac107a4700&amp;pt=d488b4ede843a783b115721d9773cf75">Spotify Playlist</a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/introduction.html" style="color: #3598db;">introduction</a></strong></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/critical-reading-assignment.html">Critical Reading Assignment - The R&amp;B Life</a></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/music-review.html">Music Review - Diving into Another Life</a></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/final-essay.html">Final Essay - Believe in Your Life</a></p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/lyrics.html">Lyrics</a> </p><p><a href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/bibliography.html">Bibliography</a></p><p> </p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ericma12345.github.io/another_life_ericma/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
